            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>I am Sujeet Bhujbal and A life-long-learner. I have done Msc(Computer Science) from Pune University.
Currently I am working as full stack Sr Software Engineer in Pune (India). I used to work withAngular 6, AngularJs, Asp.net Core , Asp.net MVC WCF, WPF, Silverlight , Asp.net 4.5/4.0/3.5/2.0, C#,.net, Xml, Ajax, jQuery, JavaScript, Sql Server 2012/2008/2005, LINQ, SL 4.0,3.0, Entity Framework 5.0,4.1, HTML 5.0,and CSS 3.0 either in office or my home.
I like to learn new concept related with WCF and WPF and share the knowledge. I like to help other developer in my free time. 

If there is one thing I would say I do well at, it’s Learning.
I am constantly doing online research of some kind or another, and love the information found on other people’s blogs, so thought I’d start my own.
No idea if I will keep with it, or if I will keep it updated, but I hope to post some useful information that I personally have had a hard time figuring out when I started out..
